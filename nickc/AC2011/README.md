# A comparison of COBOL and Python

Just a little comparison of the Sonar Depth problem using COBOL or Python.

## Lines of Code
- COBOL - 49
- Python - 14

## So why COBOL?
1. It's the first language I received a progressional qualification in. 
2. I haven't touched COBOL for a good 20+ years.
3. Why not!

## If you want to run the COBOL Program
1. Download and install guncobol (https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/)
2. Execute "cobc -x 22Day1.clb
3. Run the executable "22Day1"
